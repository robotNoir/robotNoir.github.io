For those unfamiliar, LaTeX is a sort of document preparation system that yields really high quality published documents. It's used for a lot of technical and scientific documentation including by a number of big journals. 

Unlike a word processor (ie. Word), LaTeX aims to seperate the actualy content of a document from the appearance or styling. Whilst at times it can feel a bit more intensive to write in the LaTeX 
'code' it does provide a much more consistent document and mitigates a lot of the fiddling that comes with other word processors. 

Personally, I used LaTeX when writing my MSc Thesis and aim to share some of the hints and tricks that I learnt during that process - in particuar, those relevant to anyone writing a thesis or report in chemistry.
